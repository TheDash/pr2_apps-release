  * pr2_teleop_general now depends on moveit_msgs instead of kinematics_msgs
  * Added dependency on moveit_msgs instead of kinematics_msgs
  * Removed dependency on deprecated kinematics_msgs
  * fix the disgnated files location in pr2_mannequin_mode
  * suppress compile error because of lack of catkin_LIBRARIES and LIBRARIES
  * Fixed linking of teleop_commander, it was in the wrong location
  * Removed error for linking project
  * Added bug fix for kinematics_msgs message dependency
  * Fixed CMake and package to include kinematics_msgs
  * catknize pr2_teleop_general
  * migrate to hydro, bullet -> tf
  * add yaw for control, see https://code.ros.org/trac/wg-ros-pkg/ticket/5118 for original ticket
  * add wrist orientation control through keyboard
  * port to joy in sensor_msgs
  * Fixing some bugs about what is allowed during walk_along
  * Not changing laser mode on start
  * pr2_apps:
    manifest.xml: added cxx flags for library path
  * Adding some useful launch files
  * Arm controller name was wrong
  * Needed arm controller names as more than a remap
  * Adding a couple useful launch files that don't start ik processes
  * Adding ik to joystick launch
  * Increasing options of which components (head/body/arms) to control to (I hope) make it possible to use this for a head cart with only launch file changes.  Also adding a launch file to try on the head cart
  * Initial commit of pr2_teleop_general, a package for controlling the robot's head, body, and arms with joystick and keyboard implementations
